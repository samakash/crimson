# **Product Backlog:**
# https://trello.com/b/jLQWHw8P/crimson-calm-aliens-2023


# **Users Stories & Estimates:**
1. Home Page (2 points)
2. Mood Selector (2 points)
3. Contact Us (1 point)
4. Meditation Session (4 points)
5. Content Uploader(4 points)

## **Rational of Ordering:**
- Bussiness Value
- User needs
- Importance
- Complexity
- Urgency

  
## **Rational of Estimate:**
 We estimated the smallest User story Support as 1 point because it is a single webpage with limited functionality. 
 Based on that, we are able to estimate the rest of the stories 
 
## **Definition of Ready:**
- Story has title
- Has user stories sentences/ statements (As I… I want to.. So that..)
- Story has Additional Details & Acceptance Criteria
- Story is Estimated 
- Story added to a Sprint
- Story is priortized
- Story is broken down to small tasks

## Whole Team Relative-size Estimates: 
Met for 6 hours to dicuss product vision & user 
stories and we came up with the 38 Story Points 


### **Developers participated in estimating:**
- Kamsi
- Bill
- Sam

  

# Sprint 1
-----------------

## Sprint 1 Forcast:
- 5 User Story Points

Explaination of forcast: This sprint is short with 4 business days only. Based on the product priotization, We selected the two highest priority user stories that fits the sprint.  


## The Rational of Forcast:
- Avaiable bussiness days in the sprint
- Since this is sprint 1, The team need some time to organize and work on the environment setup. 
- We have estimated our smallest user story “Support” in the product backlog which is a single webpage with a an email link as 1 point. And, we built the rest of our estimates based on that.
- This our first forcast for the first sprint. We are expecting to enhance our forcasting in future sprint based on sprint 1 outcome.

1. Home Page (2 points)
2. Mood Selector (2 points)
3. Contact Us (1 point)

* Sprint Forcast is 5 point and the user storis are matching that.

## Feedback from Stakeholder about sprint 1:
- Logo on main page is not clean looking. Need re-alignment. 
- Mood page link location is not convient
- Menu items size is small
- Contact us page needs some rework. re-align elements and revisit form size. 

Team will add the feedback as a new user story for sprint 2.  

## Sprint Retrospective: 
What is going well?
-We made a realistic velocity as our velocity was 5 and we got through 5 story points
-Our division of labor works well as everyone's skill sets are taken advantage of
-Our daily scrums made clear what we had done and what had to be completed for the next day

What isn't going well
-Impediments make it difficult to meet up physically
-Too much time spent on refactoring sprint backlog
-Tasks for Sprint backlog items needed constant adjustment and change

What we can enhance
- Detailing Impediments more concisely in our daily scrum
- Clearer tasks within PBIs taken into our sprint backlog during sprint planning
- Focus more on the MVP
  
  
## Updating PBI: 
the team reviewed the PBIs in the product backlog and made sure stories are true user stories.

- Sprint restrospective

# Our Implementation of Continuous Integration and Delivery can be found below
- CI/CD using Github Actions: https://github.com/samakash/crimson/actions

- Github Actions CI config that works whenever there is a new push to Main: https://github.com/samakash/crimson/actions/workflows/deploy_to_container_after_push.yml

#### CI/CD Steps Explaination:
 1. After a new push to main brnach, Github Action kicks off new the build
 2. Github Actions will setup environemnt variables, kickoff the tests, frontend build, backend build and packing the build to an image ready to deploy.   
 3. Wonce the build is ready and packed, it will push a new image to docker hub at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/samerakash/crimson/general
 4. Digital Ocean app configs points to the dockerhub latest push for deployment.

## Sprint Retrospective:

What is Going Well
- The team spirit
- More functionalities availble


What isn't Going Well
- We need to focus on Agile more
- Simplify code
- Need to work more on parallel tasks.
- Join meetings on time
- Make tasks more clearer

What we can Enhance
1. Aiming for a higher velocity on next sprint to accommodate more user stories
2. Understand the sprint goals ahead of schedule
3. Simplify the user stories - understand that it's a Kata
4. Make time to implement all the Agile methodologies and activities instead of focusing on the code.

Action Item: Created a new user story in the product backlog for the Retrospective outcome.
